core: 8.x

# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
distribution:
  name: Docker Distribution
  # If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
  # the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
  # a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
  # community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
  # are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
  # institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
  # profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
  # the site via Drush.
  langcode: en

# Required modules
# Note that any dependencies of the modules listed here will be installed automatically.
